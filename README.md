Course Overview

This course is designed for students in grades 12 who have a strong foundation in mathematics or computer scienceÂ  by taking the most rigorous courses Rowland Hall has to offer and wish to extend their learning through personal research projects and external coursework. Students will engage in a structured learning and research process, from proposal development to publication and presentation of their findings.

Course Objectives
To extend their knowledge in computer science or mathematics beyond what is offered at Rowland Hall.
To develop and execute a detailed research project.
To engage with academic literature and extend beyond the high school curriculum.
To gain experience in academic publishing and presentation.
Course Requirements
Regular attendance and active participation in all classes.
Completion of all assignments and adherence to project timelines.
Engagement with mentors and peers for feedback and support.
Grading Policy
Grading will be based on labor and engagement with the process, including milestone completions, quality of presentations, and the final research paper.

Regular assignments will be worth 3 points each throughout the course. Completion of these will contribute to a possible grade in the course of a B at most. They will be based on one point for each of the following:

being handed in on time
completed according to instructions
Student can and will provide reflection on the assignment for the advisor.

Students who expect to earn an A in the class will need to complete three of the following tasks (B+, A-, and A):

Complete 4 or more check-ins with their mentor(s) via an approved rubric
Complete a symposium presentation for the school of their project in December.
Publish their project in an approved venue
Present their project to an outside audience (Science Fair, Conference, etc)
